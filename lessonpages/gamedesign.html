        <h4>Lesson: Game Design Process</h4>
          <br>
        <h5>Time: &nbsp two-45 min classes</h5>

      <div class='left-frame'>
        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>This lesson is a branch from the Game Design lessons in Code.org.
          Prior to this lesson, students have learned many of the necessary components to develop a basic JavaScript game.
          The process in this lesson is centered around developing a plan for the larger project before programming the game.
          Student's are walked through a series of levels intended to scaffold their understanding of building software.</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>Students have spent weeks learning JavaScript as a program language for game development.
        Students are going to take all that knowledge and put it together as a system; however,
        they still need some guidance.
        This lesson provides students with the necessary scaffolds to undertake the process of software development.
        Code.org provides 'starter code' for the game.
        After this lesson, students will need to complete more of the development process independently.</p>

        <h6>Objectives</h6>
        <p>Plan and utilize a project guide to implement solutions in a programming language</p>
        <h6>Indiana Standards</h6>
        <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6.8.PA.1</span> &nbsp Select appropriate tools and technology resources to support learning and personal
         productivity, publish individual products, and design, develop, and publish data,
         accomplish a variety of tasks, and solve problems.</p>
         <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6-8.PA.2</span> &nbsp Implement problem solutions using a programming language that includes looping
          behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.</p>
        <h6>Materials & Resources</h6>
        <ul>
          <li>computer</li>
          <li>code.org</li>
          <li>project guide</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Assessment Opportunities</h6>
        <p>The task of programming the game will likely take 2 classes.
         At the end of this class, students will answer an exit ticket assessing their understanding
         of how a project guide helps break the programming task into manageable chunks.</p>

      <div class='lesson-main'>
        <div id='warm-up'>
          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>When students enter the code.org lesson, they are presented with a game called "Cake Defender".
           Student's should play the game and get an idea of what they will be building. Student's will
           then talk to a partner and use a blank project guide to write what variables might exist in the
           program as well as any functions or sprites.</p>
        </div>

        <div id='activity'>
          <h6>Activity</h6>
          <div id='direct-instruction'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Direct Instruction</p>
            <p>As a class, share ideas of what should be included on the project. Then the teacher should
            share a completed project guide with the correct information.
            Ask students to compare their project guide to the completed project guide. "Do you notice any differences?"  In this case, we are not looking at one list as being "correct".  We should stress
            that there are multiple ways to solve a problem.  However, we do want to stress that some
            solutions can be more efficient.</p>
            <p>Before moving forward, have students do a turn and talk with the following prompt: &nbsp
            "How does having a plan help to make a large project easier?"</p>
          </div>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>The guided part of this lesson is baked into the Code.org lesson.  The game program is
             broken down into smaller sections.  Each section provides a small amount starter code.
             The main task in this lesson is for students to write code for each of the functions.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='independent-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Independent Practice</p>
            <p>Students will spend this time writing the code needed for each section.  There are 12 sections
              for the students to work through, each with a piece of starter code. Teacher will provide
              guidance and help as necessary for students.</p>

        <div id='wrap-up'>
          <h6>Warp-up</h6>
          <p>Exit Question: </p>
          <p>How did the project guide help you when you were coding?</p>
