        <h4>Lesson: Programming Logic</h4>
          <br>
        <h5>Time: 45 mins</h5>
      </div>

      <div class='left-frame'>
        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>This lesson is one part of a series of lessons I implemented to improve students problem solving skills and pattern recognition.  The series of lessons was composed of a mixture of self-created lessons and the use of codeHS software as well as Minecraft for Education software</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>Learning to program or code can feel like an impossible task for many youth.  They get stuck in a mindset that is focused on memorizing information and therefore spend immense cognitive effort worrying about syntax or commands.  I needed to take the time to remove as much of the syntax worries as possible and focus on pattern recognition and problem solving.  If a student can focus on learning the logic involved in programming first, then learning syntax becomes easier.</p>

        <h6>Indiana Standards</h6>
        <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6-8.DI.1</span> &nbsp Use the basic steps in algorithmic problem-solving to design solutions (e.g., problem statement and exploration, examination of sample instance, design, implementing a solution, testing, and evaluation).</p>
        <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6-8.PA.2</span> &nbsp Implement problem solutions using a programming language that includes looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.</p>

        <h6>Assessment Opportunities</h6>
        <p>Although codeHS offers multiple choice quizzes, for a more complete view of student performance, consider using a series of coding puzzles to examine a student's ability to break a problem into smaller, manageable parts and looking for patterns to create efficient solutions.</p>

          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>Upon arriving, students have basic starting instructions and the Objective for the day on the projector screen.  Students are expected to start with 5-10 minutes of typing practice each class.  After giving students time to practice their typing skills and get warmed up, I will provide an overview of the day’s lesson.  In this case, continued practice of “programming logic”, connected to a 3 week long effort to improve problem solving skills and pattern recognition.</p>

            <p>Today we will be covering 1.8 and 1.9 in CodeHS - Programming with Karel.
              We are skipping 1.7 - because it is not really important to the goals of these lessons.
              It is simply learning how to “comment” in JavaScript.
              1.8 - titled “Super Karel”, is actually super easy; however, we will go through it because we need to practice the idea and skill of refactoring our code - or rewriting it to be more efficient and maintainable.
              Remember building the Two Towers in Lesson 1.6?  We are going to go to that lesson first to copy our code.
              Basically, Karel is smart now and can finally turn right.
              So, we need to refactor our code to account for the idea that Karel no longer needs a separate “turnRight()” function.
              Simply copy all of the code from 1.6 - except for the turnRight() function.  Then paste it into Lesson 1.8.  It really was that simple.
              From there, the only other step is to add a comment to one of the functions.
              A comment is created with two forward slashes.
              When we use two forward slashes at the beginning of a line, it turns that line off and the computer does not read it.
              This is also useful in testing code.
              Check your partner and make sure you both have copied the code over, minus the turnRight() function. </p>
              <p>Now, let’s move on to Lesson 1.9.
              For this one, we will go through the slides.
              You do not need to watch the video, I will just go through the slides real quick.
              Essentially, we ask the question of what do we do if we need doggo to repeat an action?
              If we need the dog to put down 100 tennis balls, are we going to write putBall() 100 times?
              Of course not.  We have “the for loop”.
              The for loop is a line of code that will help us run something a set number of times.
              [example of the “for-loop” is shown in the slides on screen]
              We will break this down a little bit to explain it.
              This one line is actually 3 separate lines.
              The first part tells the computer we start counting at 0, the second part tells the computer what we are counting UP TO, and the last part i++ tells the computer to begin counting.
              Some of you might remember the “counter pattern” from 6th grade.
              The i++ is just shorthand for the counter pattern.
              Following this pattern, the code inside the curly brackets would be the code that is executed.
              The curly brackets will be one of the things that will mess you up.
              Students will leave a curly bracket off or add an extra one; it is a very common error. </p>
              <p>We will skip the “quiz” section of this, because once again, it is not the point of these lessons.
              We are trying to learn programming logic and practice those skills.
              The quizzes are designed for you to learn small trivial parts of JavaScript.</p>
              <p>I will show you their 2 examples, which you can see as well.
              The first example just shows a repeated move.
              Based on this example “for-loop”, How many spots will doggo move? (A:  9)
              The next example is similar, except this time we see an action that happens AFTER the “for-loop” runs.  Based on this example, How many balls will the doggo set down?  (A:  6)</p>
          </div>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>At this point, we are at the exercises, which is really a chance for you to have Independent Practice.
            This is not a test, and I want to make sure you are figuring these out and see correct examples.
            So I’ll help out.
            First, I’ll walk you through 1.9.5, where doggo needs to pick up 100 tennis balls.
            Then, I’ll have you attempt each one after this - I’ll try my best to follow the pace of the class.</p>
            <p>I’m going to talk about how I approached this problem.
            First, in the start() function, what analogy do we use to think about the start function?
            [give class a chance to answer]
            We think of it as “telling a story”.
            So let’s tell the story of Karel picking up tennis balls.
            What is the first thing Karel needs to do? [class response] He needs to move one spot, so we will type move.
            Now what would Karel do?
            Well, we don’t want to write “putBall” 100 times, so I’m going to create a function for that, I will name it “takeStack”, of course, you could name it many things, but it should have a name that makes sense.
            Finally, after doggo takes the stack of tennis balls, what does doggo need to do? [class response] - He moves one more time.</p>
            <p>Now, we don’t have a pre-built function for taking a stack, so we will create one.
            [demonstrate how to write the function - which has been demonstrated many times before]
            Now, in this function we will need to create the “for-loop” because we do not want to write putBall 100 times.
            [demonstrate how to write the for-loop]
            Excellent, I’ll give time for those who need to catch up to have this example typed out.
            I want to make sure that you have at least one correct example from which to work.</p>

            <p>From here, I’m going to give you time to try to solve each of the next 3 with your partner or someone near you.
            I strongly encourage you to work with someone, bounce ideas around, and double check each other's code.</p>
            <p>After I see everyone has had time to complete an exercise, I will post the correct answer up on the screen and briefly walk you through how I solved it.
            [teacher will circulate the room and make sure students are understanding the exercises and help those who need extra help]</p>
            <p>[when students have finished an exercise or some students are stuck - teacher will display the correct way to solve the exercise with code. -- it is important to see the correct way to write it if a student is not seeing the pattern]</p>

          <h6>Warp-up</h6>
          <p>Students will be given a couple quick exit questions to check for understanding related to programming logic.</p>
          <p>(Example:  What is the analogy we use to describe programming at the start function?  -- Answer: write it like a story)</p>
