        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>There is nothing like a hands on experience to help promote curiosity.
          This lesson requires one major component that not all teachers will find easy to attain.
          To take this lesson on, you will need as many "old" computers as possible.
          Computers that are getting ready for recycling work perfect for this activity.</p>
        <p>This lesson challenges students to research the device they will open up and improve their
          understanding of hardware/software connections.  Their is a Lab paper connected to the lesson
          to help guide students through the process.</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>Being able to explore the inside of the computer will help students further their troubleshooting
          skills.  This hands-on experience, coupled with a research component, provides students with
          knowledge and an experience that they remember, helping them become independent problem solvers.</p>

          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>Students are directed to class conversation right away to maximize time for the lab.
          As a class, list some common problems each of us have encountered with computers.
          Then separate the list into categories of "software" or "hardware" problems.
          Take a moment to cover the two objectives listed for this lesson and how they are connected.
          Ask the students "How will and understanding of hardware help us with troubleshooting?"
          Let students share ideas.</p>

            <p>This lesson is geared toward research and exploration.  The teachers role is to provide
              guidance and structure to the exploration.
              Remind and review basic research skills with students prior to directing to begin research.
              Cover basic safety with a screwdriver and how best to work with their partner.</p>

            <p>Students will work on their own to complete the Computer Dissection Lab.
              The teacher will circulate to provide assistance and age appropriate explanations for hardware
              descriptions.
              When all students have successfully finished labeling AND writing the descriptions of the
              computer parts, the students will share their descriptions with at least one other student and
              see if they agree or disagree on the description being used for each part</p>

          <h6>Warp-up</h6>
          <p>There is an Exit Question included in the Lab.  Students should complete the Exit Question
          and if time allows do a "turn and talk" with a different partner.</p>
          <p>Exit Question from Lab: </p>
          <p>You are trying to play some really awesome game on Cool Math, but the website continues to
            spin.
            You remembered that you have clicked about 15 different buttons on the website while the website
            was loading.  You also noticed that the bottom of the computer feels really really hot. Using
            hardware part names, and troubleshooting strategies, explain what you believe the problem is and
            how you might solve it.</p>
