        <h4>Lesson: Graphing Gum Lab</h4>
          <br>
        <h5>Time: 45 mins</h5>
      </div>

      <div class='left-frame'>
        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>In a school that does not allow gum, this lab will usually engage a kid in the scientific process.
        Students are presented with the question of whether or not they can chomp a piece of gum at the same
        speed for 2 minutes.
        From there, they will use the "Sticky Data Lab" sheet to walk through the scientific method.
        The lab will engage them in the process of observation and data collection as well as graphing data.
        </p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>I use this lab near the beginning of the year to help engage them in the scientific method.
        Students need ample opportunities to work through the problem solving process of the scientific
        method.
        Although all the parts of the scientific method are important, this particular lab is geared
        toward mastering writing a good hypothesis and tying the analysis and conclusion back to the
        hypothesis.</p>

          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>Review the Scientific Method and specifically what qualifies as a solid hypothesis.
          I used this opportunity to play a quick review game.
          Kahoot or similar sites tend to have a healthy selection of scientific method review games.</p>

            <p>Introduce today's lab and cover the objectives.
            If student's are not already in pairs - make sure to partner students up at this time.
            Present students with the "Question" for this particular lab.
            Review how we can use the Scientific Method to answer all sorts of questions,
            including questions about chewing gum.
            Pose a true/false form of the lab question to demonstrate that their are at least two
            different views of the answer, and likely many more variations of the answer.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>Have students write their hypothesis for the lab.
            Remind students, and probably enforce, the idea that the hypothesis should be stated
            with an "if" and "then".
            The 'if' part of the hypothesis describes the experiment taking place.
            This part also contains our independent variable for our data.
            The 'then' part of the hypothesis describes our prediction.
            This part also contains our dependent variable for our data.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='independent-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Independent Practice</p>
            <p>Students, or classes, that have already practiced and conducted labs should be able to move
            forward through the lab with their partner.
            Students, or classes, with less practice will most likely need guided through the
            "Experiment Procedure" located in the
            <span class='pdf-link'>
              <a href='../resources/StickyDataLab.pdf' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
                Sticky Data Lab.
              </a>
            </span>
            Students should track and write their partners chomps on their partners paper.
            This way each student is engaged in analyzing their own data.</p>
           <p>Students could graph their data by hand; however, with my classes I hand students use
            Google Sheets for data table and would have them use the graphing features of the sheet.
            This seems like a much more useful skill to teach students at this point in time.
            We then would link the newly created graph to our "Sticky Data Lab".
           </p>
           <p>After students have completed the graph, they should continue to the "Analysis" and
           "Conclusion" parts of the lab.
            Remind students of the importance of good communication in a hypothesis.</p>
