        <h4>Lesson: Code Review</h4>

        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>A Code Review is much like the revision process you might see in ELA.
          Teams will need to allow for open testing of their program and let other developers look
          at their code to get feedback.
          Then students will 'refactor' their code (improve and hopefully look for efficiencies).
          Of course the process is not complete without retesting and getting more feedback.</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>Students need to learn both sides of the revision process.
          In this lesson, we first learn how to completely test and evaluate a program.
          Students must also learn what to do with this feedback.
          This lessons goal is to improve students critique and feedback skills through a
          'business' lens. Viewing the program as owned by a business helps to depersonalize the feedback.</p>

        <div id='warm-up'>
          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>When students enter my room, they are tasked with 'typing practice' as the traditional
            'bell ringer' of sorts.  This helps force them to get their computers open and ready for the
            assignment, as well as providing an opportunity for students to improve their typing skills.</p>
        </div>

        <div id='activity'>
          <h6>Activity</h6>
          <div id='direct-instruction'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Direct Instruction</p>
            <p>At this point, students 'feel' like they have finished their program and are ready to
              publish.  This is the biggest hurdle in the lesson.  Getting students to understand that
              revision and refactoring your code is universally important for a functioning program.</p>
            <p>We first focus on remembering that this program belongs to a business (we have created
              fake businesses for the project).  We discuss the need to take the emotion out of the
              feedback so we can provide the most useful feedback and so we can find the feedback we
              receive useful.  Students provide some examples.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>Here I demonstrate how to use the Code Review Document to help evaluate a teams program.
              This is includes a think-a-loud session of me evaluating a website - often times the most
              ridiculous and random site possible.</p>
            <div class='paper-flex'>
              <img class='code-review-form' src='../resources/codeReviewdoc.png' alt='example of a code review form'>
            </div>
            <p>I then use a test site that I create and have every student evaluate my site.
              I have a student present me with my evaluation and then talk through what I will do with
              the feedback.  We discuss the actual changes I will make to my program.  We also discuss
              how receiving the feedback might have made me feel uncomfortable or unhappy.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='independent-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Independent Practice</p>
            <p>It is at this point that the students partner with 2 different groups for the evaluation.
              Imagine a team of 4 students; 2 will partner from 1 team; and the other 2 will partner
              with another team.  In the end the team will have 4 evaluations from 2 different teams.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div id='wrap-up'>
          <h6>Warp-up</h6>
          <p>After discussing the quality of the evaluations and the need to improve code during the next
            class and retest (step 9), students will write a brief exit ticket where they
            are asked to justify their Code Review evaluation.</p>
