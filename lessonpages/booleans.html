        <h4>Lesson: Booleans</h4>
          <br>
        <h5>Time: 45 mins</h5>

        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>This lesson was done with kinesthetic learners in mind.
           I try to make sure to include activities that are not just sitting at a computer typing code.
           With this lesson, there is an included dialog sheet for the "Activity" portion</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>It can be difficult for students to grasp the idea that words used in 'logic' do not always
        share the same meaning or use with conventional English.
        In English, an 'or' is often an 'exclusive or'; such as, "You can have chicken <span class='indicator-bold'>or</span> fish".
        In English, you only get to pick one.
        With Boolean Logic, you could have chicken, fish, or both!
        In this lesson we try to help students increase understanding of logic with an activity that has them get up and move.</p>

        <h6>Objectives</h6>

        <h6>Indiana Standards</h6>
        <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6-8.PA.2</span> &nbsp Implement problem solutions using a programming language that includes looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.</p>

        <p><span class='indicator-bold'>6-8.PA.3</span> &nbsp Demonstrate dispositions amenable to open-ended problem solving and programming</p>

        <div id='warm-up'>
          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>Review vocabulary of "Booleans" and "Conditionals".
            Have students explain the terms in their own words.
            Students have worked with and heard the terms before;
            however, they have not examined booleans and how they add control to a program</p>

              </a>
            </div>
            <p>The class starts by playing a simple game of Stand Up, Sit Down in which the boolean
              (true/false) statements describe personal properties (hair or eye color, clothing type, age,
              etc).
              This gets students thinking about how they can frame a property with multiple potential values
              (such as age) with a binary question.
              Each student will be given a note card to write down answers to the personal property questions.
              I will collect the cards and inform students that we will discover who the author of the card
              is by answering basic True/False questions.
              We will then discuss the value of being able to control program functions through basic
              conditionals (if/then statements).
              Students should make a connection to the StandUp, SitDown game and note that we can eliminate
              unwanted answers by stacking multiple conditionals.
              We will then connect the use of booleans to the computers most basic functionality, binary
              code.</p>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>Work through the first sections of Lesson 11, code.org, with the class.
              The first parts of Lesson 11 ask students to predict what the program will do based on code.
              Walk students through the thinking process of making that prediction based on the information
              provided in the code.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='independent-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Independent Practice</p>
            <p>Students are given the remainder of the class period to work on Lesson 11 through Code.org.
              I provide various guidance to students throughout this time period.
              Students also use time to work with a partner to solve the various problems presented in the
              lesson.
              Students who are stronger with logical expressions spend time teaching students who need the
              extra guidance.
              At this point in the semester, most students have partnered up with the same person each class;
              however, students do (and are encouraged) to talk to other partners/students at any time they
              feel it would benefit their understanding of the problem.  </p>

          <h6>Warp-up</h6>
          <p>Students are given an 'exit ticket' with the following questions.
          How might you use conditionals to improve one of your programs from past lessons?
          What condition would you check, and how would you respond to it?</p>
