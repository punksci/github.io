        <h4>Lesson: Experimenting with Sound</h4>
          <br>
        <h5>Time: 80 mins</h5>
      </div>

      <div class='left-frame'>
        <h6>Overview</h6>
        <p>In this lesson students will investigate energy waves.
        Specifically sound waves, using a tuning fork, a stopwatch, and their own ear.
        The lab itself is highly structured and guided for use early in the school year.</p>
        <h6>Purpose</h6>
        <p>This lab serves two purposes.
        First, to have students investigate energy waves with a hands (or ear) on approach.
        Second, is to help teach students the scientific method and the process of investigating
        and conducting a lab.
        I use this lab early in the year to help students become engaged in the investigation process
        and to learn how to break problems down into smaller steps.</p>

        <h6>Assessment Opportunities</h6>
        <p>The Lab will be assessed for the understanding of the investigation process.
        The Exit Ticket will also be used to assess understanding.</p>

        <div id='warm-up'>
          <h6>Warm-up</h6>
          <p>Students have 3 words on the board that they need to research and define.
          The words are, amplitude, frequency, and wavelength.
          Review the lesson from the prior day that provided students with an online simulator
          to experience how energy waves move under various conditions.</p>

            <p class='small-heading'>Direct Instruction</p>
            <p>Students will be directed to Google Classroom to find the instructions for today’s Lab.
            I will cover the basic structure of the lab and the Question/Problem we are solving in
            order to provide background for the students to create their hypothesis.
            Students will then create their hypothesis.
            Students will then be directed to the Experiment Procedures in the lab.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='guided-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Guided Practice</p>
            <p>Following along with the Experiment Procedures, I will model how to use the Tuning Fork
            and how to time the sound of the Tuning Fork.
            I will show students where to place the Tuning Fork for the “air” measurement and
            the “bone” measurement.
            I will explain to students how to fill out the Student Sheet 7.1 where they will track their data
            and create a graph.
            Students will be shown an example horizontal graph.</p>
          </div>

          <div id='independent-practice'>
            <p class='small-heading'>Independent Practice</p>
            <p>Students will work with a partner to complete the Lab.
            One partner will time and the other will use the Tuning Fork.
            They will take turns back and forth until they each have 2 times for air and bone measurements,
            which will be written down on the Student Sheet 7.1.
            Students will then create a graph of the data and look for patterns to list
            for their Lab Observations.
            After students create their graph, they will share their graph with their partner to get feedback
            about their graph structure.
            Teacher will also circulate the room and provide guidance on the graphs.
            Once students have finalized their graph - students will then discuss 4 Analysis questions
            with their group.
            As they discuss the questions, and debate the answer,
            students will write their answer to each question in the Lab document.
            Analysis questions start at a DOK 1 and work their way up to a DOK 4 question
            asking about the relationship between the properties of a medium and the transmission of sound.

          <p>Teacher will lead discussion on Analysis questions.
          Groups will provide summary answers for each question.
          Misconceptions on the topic will be addressed by the teacher.
          Students will then be directed to answer an Exit Question through Google Classroom.
          The question assesses their understanding of the original question that was proposed for the lab:
          “How does changing the medium from a gas to a solid affect sound waves?”</p>
