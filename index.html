    <h1 class="hello">Hello</h1>
    <h3 class="iam">I'm Bryan Goeller</h3>
    <div class="bio">
      <p>I am a multi-talented problem-solver with 14 years of experience helping students find their talent
      for critical thinking.
      I engage students with curiosity and an abundance of energy, creating an educational experience for any
      young scientist or engineer that will inspire growth.
      In spite of having an abundance of energy, my demeanor in class is calm and purposeful.
      I recognize the power of a positive and welcoming atmosphere in creating an educational environment
      that helps maximize student success.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='bio-wide'>
      <p>My time in education has been filled with an array of experiences.
      Community has been the central and driving theme of these experiences.
      After graduation, I chose to work in a high poverty school.
      It was in this setting I was able to see the important role community plays in learning.
      In order to have success in the classroom, students needed to know I was a part of their community.
      From their perspective, I was an outsider, and I needed to build relationships with students
      and families before I could be truly successful.
      This was of great importance when working with students at Christel House Academy.
      </p>
      <p>The power of community was reinforced when I moved to Irvington Community Schools.
      At the time, I lived in Irvington and was one of many involved in helping revitalize the neighborhood.
      I wanted to further help the Irvington community with my skills as an educator.
      Teaching in my own community has been an empowering opportunity.
      I have been able to teach and learn with neighbors and friends, an experience that has taught
      me to do more than be a part of a community, I have learned to build a community.
      </p>
      <p>Beyond my experience as an educator, when ICS decided to become a 1:1 school with chromebooks,
      I began helping with IT at the middle school.
      While spending time learning tech support, I decided to challenge myself to learn front-end web
      development.
      Having demonstrated my skills in coding, I was asked to take on our new Computer Science class for
      the middle school.
      Currently, I teach 6-8 grade Computer Science, using a mixture of code.org, codeHS, and
      self-created lessons.  The curriculum is focused on the Indiana State Standards and geared toward
      engaging kids with projects such as creating a game using JavaScript or designing and coding a
      website with HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>My experience with web development has currently been limited to this website you are reading,
      and my experiences teaching the skills of web development.
      I have not worked in the web development industry.
      My career focus has been on education.
      Nevertheless, as my career has moved forward, I have focused on Computer Science and have spent
      five years working through online tutorials and courses to become self-taught in web development.
      I continue building programs and web applications as a way to continue to improve myself
      and challenge myself to learn new skills.
      In terms of credentials, I plan to add 'Computer Science' to my Indiana State Teaching License by taking
      the CS Praxis test as soon as possible.
      Being able to share my excitement and skills in coding with students is an experience I have
      cherished and enjoyed.
